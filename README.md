## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The topic I chose is on shark attacks and is organized by the victims' name, age, and sex. Moreover, more information such as the region of attack, date, and type of shark is noted. I have interest in this topic specifically because I enjoy surfing and spent a week near New Smyrna Beach, surfing everyday. This beach is the location with the most shark attacks yearly in the USA. Ironically, I didn't know this information till after the surfing time and was confused as to why no one else was out surfing at the beach during the length of my trip. I want to specifically explore which countries had the most attacks and what activity elicited the most shark attacks. I look forward to experimenting with the user-facing dashboard.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

As was touched in for the topic, this dataset is quite inclusive in its scope. The date of the attack is included along with the country, area, and ocean location. The type of activity is highlighted as well as the name, sex, and age of the victim. There is also a column for what kind of injury occured, if any, as well as another if it was fatal or not. The shark species is also shown in another column. There are other categories such as reference, case number, investigator, but these I am not including in my processed dataset. The attacks are recorded by Shark Attack File workers. This data is for educational purposes and the website speaks significantly about whether the shark was being aggravated or not.
